## Introduction
The recruitment process today often involves reviewing a large number of resumes, a task that can be both time-consuming and tedious for hiring teams. As the volume of applications for each job opening continues to grow, manually screening resumes can lead to errors, delays, and missed opportunities. This highlights the need for a faster and more efficient way to evaluate resumes and streamline the hiring process.

## Project Overview
Many companies today receive a large number of resumes when hiring for a job. Reviewing each one manually takes a lot of time and can lead to mistakes or biased decisions. Thus, there is a clear need for a faster and more efficient way to screen resume.

Resume Analyzer is a system developed by Computer Science students from Laguna University to assist HR teams bu automatically reading and analyzing resumes. Also to assist job seekers in improving their resumes and help recruiters screen applications more efficiently. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Unsupervised Machine Leaning for the Topic Modeling, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze and assess resume details.

## Objectives
The main objective of the Resume Analyzer is to enhances the recruitment process by automating resume screening, detecting missing information, offering structured feedback, and providing analytical insights to both recruiters and job seekers.

1. To extract and structure resume data, standardizing different formats using LLM-powered techniques.
2. To detect and highlights missing or incomplete information in resumes, providing users with actionable feedback.
3. To analyze resume context through skill gap assessments, keyword matching, and topic modeling.
4. To provide recruiters with insightful analytics and data visualizations that support objective, data driven hiring decisions.
5. To reduce bias in the screening process by standardizing resume evaluation criteria.

## Features
The main features of the project:
1. User Authentication - Users can log in and log out securely using Firebase.
2. Resume Upload - Users can upload PDF resumes through a drag-and-drop interface.
3. Text Extraction - Extracts text from uploaded resumes using pdfjs on the frontend.
4. Resume Analysis (AI-Powered) - Sends resume text to Gemini API to analyze strenghts, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions.
5. Job Role Detection (Topic Modeling) - Uses machine learning (LDA) to extract job roles or dominant topics from the resume.

## Technologies Used
Frontend:
JavaScript (React.js) - Core logic and UI rendering.
CSS - Custom styling for components and layout.
React Dropzone - For file upload (drag-and-drop feature).
pdfjs-dist - To extract text from PDF resumes directly in the browser.
Firebase Authentication - To handle user login and logout.
Axios - To make HTTP request to the backend.

Backend:
Python (FastAPI) - Handle API endpoints and backend logic.
NLTK - For natural language processing of resume text.
Scikit-learn - For topic modeling using TF-IDF and LDA.
Google Gemini API - For AI-powered resume analysis and suggestions.

Tools and Libraries:
axios - For making API calls from React to FastAPI.
CORS Middleware - To allow frontend-backend communications.
pydantic - For request validation in FastAPI.
